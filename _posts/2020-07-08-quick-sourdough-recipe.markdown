## Making Loaf
Wait until starter reaches peak and make dough right after this. This is when starter is ready to make the loaf.

Ingredients:
* 160 G Starter
* 400 G Flour
* 230 G Water
* 5 G Salt

Knead and check opacity for "window pane" effect. This is when its ready for first proof. Then let it sit for 3 hours. 

Knead again and let it sit for another 2 or 3 hours. At this point you can put it in the fridge and let it prove overnight if you want. 

Oven Prep - 450 Deg for 30-35 Minutes. Keep an eye on it
