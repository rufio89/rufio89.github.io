## Intermitten Fasting Meals
I am starting to do a 16x8 intermittent fasting schedule. This means you fast for 16 hours and eat within an 8 hour window. I split out the meal plan by day and formulated 2 meals per day. I want the meals to follow a pescatarian diet (vegeterian + fish). 

1. **Day 1:**
   - Breakfast: Tofu scramble with spinach, tomatoes, and nutritional yeast. Whole-grain toast.
   - Dinner: Lentil and mixed vegetable stew. [Recipe](https://minimalistbaker.com/lentil-mushroom-stew-over-mashed-potatoes/)
   - Water Intake: 3 bottles (25 fl oz each)

2. **Day 2:**
   - Breakfast: Vegan yogurt with mixed berries, granola, agave nectar.
   - Dinner: Chickpea curry with brown rice. [Recipe](https://hostthetoast.com/easy-chickpea-curry/)
   - Water Intake: 3 bottles (25 fl oz each)

3. **Day 3:**
   - Breakfast: Smoothie with banana, peanut butter, almond milk, vegan protein powder.
   - Dinner: Black bean and sweet potato chili. [Recipe](https://simple-veganista.com/sweet-potato-black-bean-chili/)
